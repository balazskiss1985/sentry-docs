To add an attachment, you can either add it to the scope or pass it to any of the `capture` methods.

### Passing Attachments to Capture

You may pass attachments to any of the `capture` methods, for example, when capturing an exception:

```kotlin
import io.sentry.kotlin.multiplatform.Attachment
import io.sentry.kotlin.multiplatform.Sentry

val fileAttachment = Attachment("your/path/file.log")

Sentry.captureException(IllegalStateException()) { scope ->
  scope.addAttachment(fileAttachment)
}
```
